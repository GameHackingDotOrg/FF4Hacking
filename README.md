# FF4Hacking
FF4Hacking is a documentation project for Final Fantasy IV on SNES (originally referred to as Final Fantasy II in the US), for use primarily by ROM hackers.

For the moment (and possibly forever), all content can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/GameHackingDotOrg/FF4Hacking/wiki).
